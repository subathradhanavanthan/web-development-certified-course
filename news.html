    <h2 class="nation">Delhi blast LIVE: Bomb 'premature' as suspect in rush due to police raids, initial probe shows; death toll at 13</h2>
    <h4 class="nation">The death toll in the car explosion near New Delhi Red Fort stands at 13, and the investigation has been handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Initial investigation, as of Tuesday (November 11, 2025), seems to suggest a doctor from Pulwama was likely the sole occupant of the vehicle that exploded on Monday (November 10). The bomb was “premature” as the person was said to be acting in haste due to pressure of police raids that had already led to the arrest of two colleagues. 

The Lal Quila Metro Station will remain closed on Wednesday (November 12) as a precautionary measure, in view of heightened security across the national capital following the explosion. All other stations are functional as normal, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said on social media. </h3>
  <p class="nation">In a big revelation in the Delhi blast case, key suspect Muzammil has told the investigators that he and Umar had recced the Red Fort before the explosion in the area left nine people dead.</p>
